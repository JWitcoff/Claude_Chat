## Recognition Backend Options

### Free Options
1. **Google Speech Recognition**
   - Pros: Fast (~500ms), good accuracy, no setup
   - Cons: Requires internet, rate limits

2. **Whisper Local**
   - Pros: Free, offline, good accuracy
   - Cons: Higher latency (1-3s), CPU intensive

### Premium Options (Future)
3. **OpenAI Realtime API**
   - Pros: Ultra-low latency (<300ms), excellent accuracy
   - Cons: ~$0.06/min for audio input

4. **ElevenLabs Voice API**
   - Pros: Very low latency, high accuracy
   - Cons: Similar pricing to OpenAI

---

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Backend-agnostic design**: Easy to switch between recognition engines
2. **MCP integration**: Seamless Claude Code interaction
3. **Queue-based**: Handle multiple rapid commands
4. **Threaded listening**: Non-blocking continuous operation
5. **Fallback strategy**: Google → Whisper → Error handling

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| High latency | Start with Google, add Realtime API option |
| Poor accuracy | Multiple backend fallback system |
| CPU usage | Wake word detection, optimized threading |
| API costs | Free tier first, optional premium |
| Platform compatibility | Test on macOS/Windows/Linux |
